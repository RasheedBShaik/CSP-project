          The first week shows promising early signs of increased internet usage
          and improved digital engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further interventions and continuous monitoring are recommended to
          sustain and build on these initial gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          By collecting and analyzing this data, you can gauge the early impact
          of your CSP project on internet usage in the villages and adjust your
          strategies accordingly for sustainedÂ improvement.
